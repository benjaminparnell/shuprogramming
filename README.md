shuprogramming
==============

Shu Programming is a computer programming club at Sheffield Hallam University founded by [Benjamin Parnell](https://github.com/benjaminparnell), [Rowell Heria](https://github.com/rowellheria) and [Martyn Rushton](https://github.com/martynrushton).


Our aim is to spread our knowledge between the best and most motivated students at our university. We currently hold weekly sessions where we have presentations about the most requested topics and then brainstorm and implement some of our ideas.


The Facebook group page can be viewed [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/659319207467018/).


All of our code, presentations and notes can be found in this repositary.
