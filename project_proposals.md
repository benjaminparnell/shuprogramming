Name : Joshua Bates

Project Name : Lecture Voting System

Project Overview : A web app that allows students in a lecture hall to ask questions that are relevant to the topic, but not urgent enough to distrupt the lecture. The lecturer will be able to cross of the questions answered and then he will be reminded later on via alter to answer his unanswered questions via email.
