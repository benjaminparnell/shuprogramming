Name : Joshua Bates

Project Name : Lecture Voting System

Project Overview : A web app that allows students in a lecture hall to ask
questions that are relevant to the topic, but not urgent enough to distrupt the
lecture. The lecturer will be able to cross off the questions answered and then
he will be reminded later via email to answer any that weren't answered.

Project Overview : An app I have been thinking about for a while but never actually made. What if, you only needed one app. This one app would contain your most used app and combine them, stopping you messing around switching between facebook and twitter. 
Using api's it could be possiblt to create a 'super app' that just has a bunch of tabs with a swipe (if we did it mobile) or click (if we did it desktop) to go between them. For instance you could have Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Snapchat(mob), Sublime Text (desk) and evernote all in one app just by dragging API's. 
**I am not 100% sure on all the API's, but some of them (facebook, twitter, github) should work pretty easily**
